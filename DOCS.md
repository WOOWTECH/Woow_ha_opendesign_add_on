# Woow HA OpenDesign

## Configuration

This add-on intentionally has no options. Configure providers in the OpenDesign UI, not in Home Assistant.

Provider keys remain in the current browser's `localStorage`. They are not stored in `/data/opendesign`, are not part of a Home Assistant backup, and must be entered again in each browser. Clearing site data removes them.

## Access and persistence

Use **Open Web UI** or the **OpenDesign** sidebar item. The service is ingress-only and has no published LAN port.

Projects, the OpenDesign database, application configuration, connector data, and generated state are stored beneath `/data/opendesign`. The add-on requests cold backup so this directory is captured while the service is stopped.

## Exports

| Format | Support |
|---|---|
| Standalone HTML | Supported by OpenDesign |
| Project ZIP | Supported by OpenDesign |
| PNG / JPEG | Supported; the HA image dialog is bridged to `/export/image` |
| Screenshot PDF | Supported; the HA PDF action is bridged to the binary `/export/pdf-image` download |
| Screenshot PPTX | Supported; choose screenshot mode for one full-slide image per PowerPoint slide |
| Editable PPTX | **Unsupported**; the renderer returns an explicit error |

The add-on does not inject the desktop vector-PDF exporter: upstream's browser client interprets that endpoint as a desktop save and would download nothing. The narrow HA bridge instead redirects the existing browser PDF request to the screenshot PDF endpoint and triggers a normal browser download. The image bridge intercepts only PNG/JPEG saves; other upstream browser formats retain their upstream behavior.

Rendering is serialized and bounded by an absolute two-minute deadline, 64 slides, aggregate pixel/output-byte limits, canonical output-path confinement, capped remote-resource concurrency/bytes, and a network policy. Each remote-resource permit is held from DNS policy evaluation through pinned fetch completion, preventing model-authored HTML from starting unbounded DNS lookups. CJK and color emoji fonts are installed in the image. Oversized decks and pages fail with a bounded-size error instead of exhausting add-on memory. Renderer documents can load inline `data:`/`blob:` resources, project assets from the exact OpenDesign origin, and public HTTP(S) resources after DNS/IP validation and pinned connection. WebSockets are disabled; Supervisor, link-local, private, CGNAT, and other loopback destinations are blocked to keep model-authored HTML from reaching the HA network.

## Release policy

CI validates and smokes every build before architecture work. Pull requests and `main` build without pushing under `contents: read`; only an exact `v<config-version>` tag starts a publisher with `packages: write`. Its preflight fails closed unless both architecture version tags are absent from GHCR. Version tags are immutable: a partial architecture release cannot be retried over the same version and requires a version bump plus a new matching Git tag.

## Local runtimes

The upstream Local CLI page is intentionally unchanged. This add-on does not install, discover, or mount any host AI command-line runtime, so every local runtime remains unavailable. Use OpenDesign's API/BYOK provider mode.

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank page or missing assets:** restart the add-on, then reload the HA page without cache. Report the missing root-relative URL and add-on logs; ingress adaptation is coupled to the pinned OpenDesign version.
- **Generation cannot authenticate:** re-enter/test the provider key in this browser. There is no corresponding HA option.
- **Key disappeared:** browser storage was cleared or a different browser/profile is in use. HA restore cannot restore browser-local keys.
- **Editable PPTX fails:** expected. Choose the screenshot/image PPTX mode.
- **Image/PDF export says renderer failed:** check logs for Chromium errors and reduce page dimensions/length.
- **Watchdog restart:** if nginx or OpenDesign exits, the launcher deliberately stops its peer and exits so Supervisor can restart the complete pair.
